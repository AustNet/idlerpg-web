     Please only use in very special circumstances; otherwise, have them form
     a new player and DEL the old one. This should not let you overwrite an
     existing account, but is untested.

PUSH <char name> <seconds>, push a player toward his goal by subtracting time
     from his next time to level. Please use this only if b0t has mistakenly
     penalized someone. You could also use this to punish a user by setting
     the number of seconds to a negative number. Don't do that.

DEL <char name>, remove a user's account.

ALERT <message>, send a non-penalized privmsg to channel. Don't use this to
     chat!

JUMP <server[:port]>, move the bot to another server.

SILENT <mode>, switch bot between 4 modes of silence.
     - mode 0, bot sends all privmsgs.
     - mode 1, only chanmsg() is disabled.
     - mode 2, only privmsg()/notice() to non-channels is disabled.
     - mode 3, privmsgs/notices to users and channels are disabled.

BACKUP, tell bot to copy $opts{'dbfile'} to .dbbackup/$opts{'dbfile'}TIMESTAMP

RELOADDB, force bot to reload player database file, rewriting all memory.
     RELOADDB can only be used while in pause mode.
